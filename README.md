# 🎬 Movie Searching React App

## Overview

This project is a React application designed for searching and exploring movie details, built using Vite.js as the underlying framework. Throughout the development process, several key technologies and libraries have been employed, such as Context API, Redux, React Router DOM, useParams, and Material UI. The application retrieves movie data from the OMDB Movie API.

## Features

### 🔄 Context API

The React Context API has been implemented to manage the global state of the application. This allows for a centralized data store that can be accessed and modified by various components, streamlining state management.

### 🚀 Redux

Redux is utilized for state management, providing a predictable and centralized state container. This ensures that the state of the application is well-organized and can be easily managed across different components.

### ⚙️ React Router DOM

The application incorporates React Router DOM for navigation and routing. This enables dynamic rendering of components based on the URL, enhancing the overall user experience and making the application more responsive.

### 🔗 useParams

The React Router DOM's useParams hook is employed to extract parameters from the URL. This feature enhances the flexibility of the application, allowing for dynamic content rendering based on specific parameters.

### 🎨 Material UI

Material UI components are integrated to enhance the visual appeal of the application. These components provide a cohesive and modern design, contributing to a better user interface.
